Javascript checks if  a given number is prime, if not, shows all divisors.

At first, there is just a screen with a input field, the check button and some links. 

Once the user fill the field and hit check button, it will run JS searching for divisors for that number.

Then, the list of all divisors will appear, or the text confirming that number is prime.

Along with them, two buttons will spawn, letting the user search for the next or the previous prime number from the first given number.

Do you have time? Try the number 6402373705728000 (it's just 18factorial), and 25 seconds later you will see a respectable list of divisors.
